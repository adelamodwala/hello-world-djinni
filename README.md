# Hello World Djinni

Share Service level code written in C++ between Java and Objective-C/Swift by using Dropbox's Djinni. 

To test the project, simply open up `android_project/HelloWorld` in Android Studio or `ios_project/` in Xcode, build and run! All of the UI code is specific to the native platform (think Controllers and native UI components), whereas the "backend" is all C++.
